# Horeseaon: Code Refactor

My task was to view the source code by identifying semantic HTML elements. I followed this logic for the CSS document as well. I also needed to add alt attributes to image elements in the HTML file.

The purpose of this task is  to enhance the eperience of the end users, but also to improve structure and readability of the anyone reviewing the code.

I started by finding the dev elements and assessing the structure in order to assign the apropriate attributes in the correct places.
