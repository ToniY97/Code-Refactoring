Horiseon: Code Refactor

My task was to view the source code and improve the semantic structure of HTML elements. I followed this logic for the CSS document as well.

The purpose of this task is  to enhance the experience of the end user, but also to improve structure and readability for anyone reviewing the code.

I started by finding the dev elements and assessing the structure in order to assign the appropriate attributes in the correct places, and added alt attributes to image elements in the HTML file. I also added comments on each section/line where appropriate. I did the same thing with elements in the CSS file, matching attributes with HTML file and adding comments.
